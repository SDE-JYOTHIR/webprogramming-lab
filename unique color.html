css sectors are used to"find"(or select) the HTML elements you want to style.We can divide CSS selectors in to five categories:
simple selectors(select elements based on name,id,class)
Combinator selectors(select elements based on a specific relationship  between them)
Pseudo-class selectors(select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo -elements selectors(select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors(select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

<p>The id selector uses the id attributeof an HTML element to select a specific element.The id of an element is unique within a page,so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id,write a hash (#)charactor,followed by the id of  the element...</p>
<div class="center">The class selector select HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select  element with a specific class,write a period(.)character,followed by the class name.
you can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
